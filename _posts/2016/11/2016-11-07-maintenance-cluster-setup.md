SonarCloud will be unavailable Monday 7th of November, from 3:00 PM to 4:30 PM (CEST), due to the setup of the cluster.

With [version 6.1](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sonarqube/6Si7PMUagJA/eF4-DatvAQAJ), SonarQube has now built-in
clustering capabilities - even though they are not ready for end users yet.
This maintenance operation will set up the first cluster for SonarCloud.
