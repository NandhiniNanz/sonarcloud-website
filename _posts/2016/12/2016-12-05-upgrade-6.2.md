SonarQube.com will be unavailable Monday 5th of December, from noon to 1 PM (CEST), due to the upgrade
to SonarQube 6.2 (RC2) that brings new features to help you focus on what matters to you.

The main features that will be available after this upgrade and that might be of interest for you are:

- **New landing page** for non authenticated users
  - SonarQube's new anonymous landing page is designed to introduce users to the main concepts of SonarQube
    and to encourage them to read the "Get Started" guide to benefit from the best user experience.
- **New "Projects" page**
  - This page is designed to make it easy to explore the projects available on SonarQube, giving information
    on their main characteristics in the glimpse of an eye.
  - When authenticated, it becomes your landing page - and in that case shows your favorite projects to give
    you an immediate feeling of their health.
- **Enhanced "Issues" page**
  - Just as "Projects" shows what matters to you (i.e. your favorite projects) once you've logged in, "Issues"
    will show by default all the bugs, vulnerabilities and code smells that are assigned to you - sorting them
    by most recent issues first so that you immediately see your "leak".
  - A nice consequence is that when displayed in the context of a project, the "Issues" page will make it straightforward
    to actually visualize the "leak" of the project.
