SonarCloud will be unavailable from 11 AM to 3 PM (CEST) due to the upgrade
to SonarQube 6.0 RC1.

The main features that will be available after this upgrade and that might be of
interest for you are:

- **New "My Account > Projects" page**
  - List all the projects for which you have administration rights, with most
  important information (last date of analysis and quality gate status) available
  on the screen
- **SonarQube detects when a file has been renamed or moved**
  - The status of existing issues on such files is correctly kept
  - As a consequence, the Leak period now shows only real new issues on which you should focus
- **Redesign of the permissions page**
  - Filter on users/groups and on permissions
  - Manage all permissions on the same screen
