SonarQube.com will be unavailable from 11 AM to 3 PM (CEST) due to the upgrade
to SonarQube 6.0 RC1.

Sorry for the inconvenience.

The main features that will be available after this upgrade and that might be of
interest for you are:

- **New "My Account > Projects" page**
  - List all the projects for which you have administration rights, with most
  important information (last date of analysis and quality gate status) available
  on the screen
- **SonarQube detects when a file has been renamed or moved**
  - The status of existing issues on such files is correctly kept
  - As a consequence, the Leak period now shows only real new issues on which you should focus
- **Redesign of the permissions page**
  - Filter on users/groups and on permissions
  - Manage all permissions on the same screen
