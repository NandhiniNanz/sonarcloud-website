SonarQube.com will be unavailable Monday 26th of September, from 10 AM to 1 PM (CEST), due to the upgrade
to SonarQube 6.1 RC1.

The main features that will be available after this upgrade and that might be of
interest for you are:

- **More actionnable Leak information on Project Home page**
  - Everything displayed in the Leak area is now clickable to get exact details of what's happening on your project during this period
  - More precisely, for duplications, the figure represents the percentage of duplicated lines on the new or updated lines only.
- **Redesign of Project administration pages**
  - They now fit better in the overall look and feel of the product
