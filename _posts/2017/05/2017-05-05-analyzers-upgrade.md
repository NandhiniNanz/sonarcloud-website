SonarJava, SonarCFamily and SonarC# have been upgraded to their latest release version.

To know more about what you can expect, please read the product
news:
- [SonarJava 4.9](https://www.sonarsource.com/resources/product-news/2017/05/2017-05-05-SonarJava-4-9-released.html)
- [SonarCFamily 4.8](https://www.sonarsource.com/resources/product-news/2017/05/2017-05-05-SonarCFamily-4-8-released.html)
- [SonarC# 5.10](https://www.sonarsource.com/resources/product-news/2017/05/2017-05-05-SonarCsharp-5-10-released.html)

Please also note that the support for the Groovy language has been dropped. SonarSource
does not develop this analyzer (this is a community one), so we would not be able to provide
a reliable service with it in the future. We hope that you will keep on enjoying SonarQube.com
for all the various other languages that it supports.
