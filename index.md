SonarSource provides SonarQube.com for any open source project, free of charge. The service is provided on a best effort basis and it may happen that it incurs occasional disruptions.

SonarSource expects users of this free service to use it in a reasonable manner, consume what they really need and comply to a certain etiquette:

- analyses should not be ran too frequently - a dozen of analyses per day is generally sufficient
- a user should not use the service on hundreds or thousands of projects

The service is currently in Beta version and available only on invitation. Feel free to fill a request on the ["Contact" page](/contact/).
