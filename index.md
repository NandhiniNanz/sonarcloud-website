**[SonarQube.com](https://sonarqube.com)** is a service operated by **[SonarSource](http://www.sonarsource.com)**, the company that develops and promotes open-source code quality products **[SonarQube](http://www.sonarqube.org)** and **[SonarLint](http://www.sonarlint.org)**.

SonarSource provides SonarQube.com for open source projects, free of charge. The service is provided on a best-effort basis, and there may be occasional disruptions.

SonarSource expects users of this free service to use it in a reasonable manner, consume what they really need, and comply with a certain etiquette:

- analyses should not be run too frequently - no more than a dozen per day is generally quite sufficient
- a single account should not be used to analyze hundreds or thousands of projects

The service is currently in Beta, and available on an invitation-only basis. Feel free to submit a request for an invitation on the ["Contact" page](/contact/).
